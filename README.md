# Principles of Programming Languages Project

This project is a part of the **Principles of Programming Languages** course and focuses on implementing a lexical and syntax analyzer using **Flex** and **Bison**. The goal is to analyze XML-like pseudo-code used in Android layout design and verify its correctness.

## Project Structure

### Files

- **Lab Exercise 2023.pdf**: Contains the project description and lab exercises.
- **lex.yy.c**: Generated C file from the Flex specification that performs lexical analysis.
- **lexer.l**: Flex specification file defining the lexical analyzer.
- **myParser**: The main parser executable.
- **parser.tab.c**: C source file generated by Bison from the grammar specification.
- **parser.tab.h**: Header file generated by Bison to define tokens and `YYSTYPE`.
- **parser.y**: Bison grammar file defining the syntax rules for the XML-like pseudo-language.
- **Files for testing functionality**: Contains sample XML files for testing the parser.

### Key Concepts

This project revolves around the analysis of a subset of XML syntax, commonly used in Android app development. The main goal is to verify that the XML pseudo-code adheres to the defined grammar and rules.

## How to Run

1. **Compile** the Flex and Bison files:

    ```bash
    bison -d parser.y
    flex lexer.l
    gcc -o myParser parser.tab.c lex.yy.c -lfl
    ```

2. **Run the parser with an XML file:**

    ```bash
    ./myParser file_name.xml
    ```

    - If the XML file is syntactically correct, the parser will output:

        ```
        Parsing completed successfully.
        ```

    - If the XML file has errors, the parser will output an appropriate error message. For example:

        ```bash
        Invalid value for padding: -50
        ```

### Example Usage
**Correct:**
```bash
./myParser correct.xml
```
Output:
```bash
Parsing completed successfully.
```

**Wrong:**
```bash
./myParser wrong.xml
```
Output:
```bash
Invalid value for padding: -50
```
